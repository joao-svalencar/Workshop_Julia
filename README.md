# Introduction to Julia Workshop

### Held by International Biogeographical Society .feat Michael Borregaard and Timothée Poisot
 
On March 1st I attended to the Intro to Julia Workshop held by ISB. At first, we got explanations on how Julia differs from R; in a second moment we learned some sintax and some situations to be aware about, especially when used to the R language; in a third moment we were introduced to a script related to Species Distribution Modelling; and finally Michael and Timothée answered a few questions from attendees.
